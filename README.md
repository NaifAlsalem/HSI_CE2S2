# HSI_CE2S2
This repo will host all the HSI scripts developed by the team members.  

If the scripts are well-developed, we might consider compiling a HSI library for the CH4 and release it for the public. 

This link will lead to the minerals working group webpage: https://nasa.github.io/LPDAAC-Data-Resources/external/Working_with_EMIT_L2B_Mineralogy.html 

# HSI Tasks 
1- Radiometric Model (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

2- Spectral & Spatial Analysis of CH4 data 

3- CH4 Retrieval using Radiative Transfer algorthims such as MODTRAN etc
